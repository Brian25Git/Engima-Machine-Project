# Engima-Machine-Project
**An implementation of encrypting and decrypting messages with Enigma machines used by Germany during WWII (language: Java)**

This project delves into the fascinating world of the Enigma machines famously utilized by Germany during World War II for encrypting military communications. Offering a deeper exploration beyond the surface, you'll embark on constructing a simulator for a generalized version of these complex cryptographic devices. From understanding the intricate design and operation of the Enigma to implementing its algorithms, your program will decode and encode messages using a reciprocal encryption method. Dive into the mechanics of substitution ciphers, progressive permutations, and rotor configurations, as you recreate the intricate workings of this iconic wartime encryption technology.
